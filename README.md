## CMD-shell from under C#
 
This emulates work with CMD console. Just like you typing in the console. But now you invoke your commands from C#.

I use this approach to execute a bunch of CMD commands and batch files from under .NET FrameWork C# in a single CMD console.

See [Program.cs](https://github.com/it3xl/CMD-shell_from_under_csharp/blob/master/Program.cs) file.
