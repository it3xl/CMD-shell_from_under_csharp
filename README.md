## CMD multiple commands from under C#
 
This emulates work with CMD console. Just like you typing in the console. But now you invoke your commands from C#.

I use this approach to execute a bunch of multiple CMD commands and batch files from under .NET FrameWork C# in a single CMD console.

Implementation [CmdShell.cs](https://github.com/it3xl/cmd-multiple-commands-from-under-csharp/blob/master/CmdShellProj/CmdShell.cs)

Usage [Program.cs](https://github.com/it3xl/cmd-multiple-commands-from-under-csharp/blob/master/ConsoleRunner/Program.cs).
